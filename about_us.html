  <p id = 'one'>Pat Wilkins was born and raised in Forks, WA., where salmon fishing and farming is just a natural part of life. A graduate of the University of Washington, Pat opened shop in 2005 after deciding that coding just wasn't for him. 13 years later, Salmon-Cookies are a hit. We invite you to share in the love and enjoy the Wilkin's family recipe. </p>
  <p id = 'two'>Pat lives with his wife, Sheryl, in Mercer Island. Sheryl is an investment banker with an international portfolio of ultra-high-net-worth individuals. They have 2 Children, Sam and Will, who won't be able to find jobs as adults.</p>
